# Submission for Shakepay Coding Assignment

This web app is developed using Blazor Web Assembly, part of the .Net 6 Framework. I am familiar with Vue and Node.js, but have been working on a mainly .Net/C# stack the last few years and thought I could spin-up an app the quickest using this stack. The web app is hosted using firebase and the can be reach [HERE](https://shakepayassignment.web.app/)

To run the application you must [install the latest version of .net 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0).

One you have a clone of the repo and .NET 6 installed, in the ShakepayApp directory run the command
```
dotnet run
```
The project should now be running on a port specified in the console. Likely https://localhost:7298.
